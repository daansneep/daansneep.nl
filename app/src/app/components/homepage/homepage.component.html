          My name is Daan Sneep, I am {{ age }} years old and am currently living in Southern Holland in the Netherlands.
          I'm currently studying Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.hsleiden.nl/">University of Applied Sciences
          in Leiden</a>, to become a <strong><em>Full Stack Developer</em></strong>. So far I have learned a lot about many current
          technologies, and am looking to learn as many as possible to appeal to the varying job market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I am currently still studying, I am not looking for any full-time oppertunities. <em>If</em>, however, you are interested
           in my capabilities feel free to contact me!
