      <p>My name is Daan Sneep, I am {{ age }} years old and am currently living in Southern Holland in the Netherlands.
        I'm currently studying Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.hsleiden.nl/">University of Applied Sciences
        in Leiden</a>, to become a Full Stack Developer. So far I have learned a lot about many current technologies,
        and am looking to learn as many as possible to appeal to the varying job market.
